## LSP Configuration and Keybinding Setup for Neovim
**Date:** 2025-09-05

### Changes Made:
- Added mason-lspconfig.nvim plugin to Packer configuration for better LSP server management
- Configured gopls (Go Language Server) with proper settings including staticcheck, gofumpt, and unused parameter analysis
- Set up automatic gopls initialization for Go files with root directory detection for go.mod
- Created LSP keybindings: `<leader>gd` for definition, `<leader>gh` for hover, `<leader>gr` for references
- Integrated Telescope for LSP navigation with preview windows
- Added LSP debug keybinding `<leader>ld` to check active LSP clients and their status
- Added quickfix window close keybinding `<leader>qc`
- Moved git signs toggle from `<leader>gt` to `<leader>gs` to avoid conflicts
- Created seventh FTerm terminal instance with same dimensions as sixth (80% width/height)
- Added numpad 9 keybinding (`<k9>`) for toggling seventh terminal

### Current Status:
All LSP functionality is working properly. Gopls successfully attaches to Go files and provides definition jumping, hover documentation, and reference finding through Telescope's preview interface. The simplified keybinding scheme (gd, gh, gr) provides clean navigation without the quickfix window popup issue.

### Unresolved Issues:
- None - all requested functionality is working
